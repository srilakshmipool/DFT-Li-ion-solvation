# DFT-Li-ion-solvation
## Basic DFT Study of Li⁺ Solvation in Carbonate Electrolytes 
This repository contains a computational chemistry project looking into lithium (Li) ion - solvent interactions in carbonate based battery electrolytes at a molecular level. With a focus on ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) solvents, I constructed isolated solvent molecules and Li⁺ solvent molecules, and utilised DFT to analyse their ion-dipole and non covalent interactions. Extending from a single solvent system, incremental solvation of small Li(EC)₂ was examined. Vibrational frequency calculations were performed to confirm the stability of optimised structures and to analyse low frequency modes associated with Li⁺ coordination. To ensure trend retention and to check comparison, binding energies were recalculated using a different exchange correlation functionals.
